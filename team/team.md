Head of group

`TOK/(MST,DEMO) | STEL/(ALPS,OPT,W7X) | EDU/(PLASMA,IT)`

Theoretical plasma physicist with core expertize on Hamiltonian theory and symplectic methods for the guiding-center approximation of plasma particles. My broader vision in theory and modeling is to establish physics-consistent numerics and data analysis with consistent uncertainty propagation to the end result. I teach plasma theory and programming lectures oriented towards practice in research and scientific software development. Lately, the experimentalist Georg Harrer and I initiated the ALPS project on small stellarators. You can find more resources on my [personal website](https://krystophny.github.io/).

Here is a short text about who I am and what's im doing. Maybe some links to my [teaching]{% link students/teaching.md %} or some publication on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/itpplasma).

PhD student  

`TOK/MST | STEL/W7X`

I'm a PhD student and fellow of the Freidrich Schiedel Foundation of Energy Technology working in the area of Plasma Response to Magnetic Pertubations. Apart from my research, I enjoy listening to and making music.

### Jonatan Schatzlmayr
PhD student

`TOK/MST | STEL/W7X`

I am a PhD student funded by the KKKÖ (Kommission für die Koordination der Kernfusionsforschung in Österreich). My work deals with the kinetic modelling of ions in fusion devices with realistic collision operators. In my free time, I like to play the piano, do sports and engage in religious activities.
