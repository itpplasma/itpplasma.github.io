#### Visiting Japan
*Christopher Albert*

6 June 2023

I am currently visiting Japan to collaborate with Shinsuke Satake and Hiroe Igami from the National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS) on analysis of
experimental data from the Large Helical Device (LHD) -- the second-largest stellarator in the world after Wendelstein 7-X. Here you can see the visitor's
center with a poster showing the inside of its vacuum vessel and a happy mascot.
