## Welcome to the (new) Homepage of the Plasma Physicist's at TU Graz!

This _README_ will give a short intoduction to the Github-Pages structure of [itpplasma.github.io](href="https://itpplasma.github.io/"). It's supposed to help add posts, edit pages or the whole site, and give some explanations to the html-background "code". 

To this date (06.04.2023), both the github page as well as this readme are yet to be finished, and if you're reading this (also at a later point) and this sentence here has not been deleted yet, you will find this repository in, well, quite a messy state. I'm very sorry for that, I'll try to fix it as soon as possible!

If you want to add some information or a post to the ITP Plasma Homepage, and you cannot find instructions in this _README_ yet, I'm still working on the structure of the page. In this case, please get in touch with me, ideally at the next meeting or via e-mail: vkeusch@student.tugraz.at Thanks a lot!
